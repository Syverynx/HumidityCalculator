# Humidity calculator
Humidity-calculating tool that'll help you decide whether you should open your window or not, based on information found on [Cactus2000's website](https://www.cactus2000.de/uk/unit/masshum.shtml). 
While basic functionality has been implemented, I have more features planned for this program.
